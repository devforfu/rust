# Rust Playground

A repository created to implement snippets and small programs while reading the following Rust books.

1. [The Rust Programming Language.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
2. [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)

## Contents

The project is organized as a bunch of Rust crates. Each folder is (somewhat loosely) dedicated to a certain
language topic. Some are more involved, while others are just small snippets.

* `fern_sim` - toy example to show Rust modules layout;
* `smart_pointers` - figuring out how Rust pointers work;
* `structs` - playing around with structs and enums;
* `oop` - structuring code in the OOP way;
* `concurrency` - practicing concurrency primitives;
* `minigrep` - an example from Rust's CLI book;
* `web` - a trivial web-server;
* `advanced` - an umbrella crate for everything else.
