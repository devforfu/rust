# Rust Playground

A repository created to implement snippets and small programs while following [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.

## Contents

The project is organized as Rust workspace with many sub-projects inside. The top-level `src` folder is just a Hello-world entry point. Other folders
contain code snippets on specific topics.

* `smart_pointers` - figuring out how Rust pointers work;
* `oop` - structuring code in the OOP way;
* `concurrency` - practicing concurrency primitives;
* `minigrep` - an example from Rust's CLI book;
* `web` - a trivial web-server;
* `advanced` - everything else.
